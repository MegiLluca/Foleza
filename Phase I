Description:
Nowadays we all know the difficulty of renting an apartment in a short time especially in crowded cities like Tirana, the long hours spent finding contact channels with house owners and in some cases no one  showing up. Property-Express is created to make your life easier as a website that enables people to list, search and book apartments for rent for a short-term period. Everyone who visits Albania for a short time (tourists, businessman etc) can search for apartments or houses, which can be rented for a varying period of time from 1 day to several weeks.
There are two main factors, user and administrator. The administrator is primarily responsible for maintenance of data coming from users. The user is offered several services such as: creating an account where their personal data, rented or desired houses, the possibility of searching for the house by city names, dates available or types of houses, listing of houses and also booking them.


The goal of the project is to create a website that enables users to list apartments for rent and then search for such within the territory of Albania. It is expected that for ease of choice, many users will prefer this website. The benefit of the developer group will be from advertisements that are made by different companies.

Experience in several techniques and programming languages, the possibility to make in-depth research on them. Monetary profit through advertisement.
